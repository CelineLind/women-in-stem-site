                        Hypatia was one of the earliest recorded female mathematicians. She was born sometime between 350 and 370 CE in Alexandria, Egypt.
                        <!-- Anything notable from her time at univeristy/college? -->			Her father taught her mathematics and astronomy, which she became an expert in. She began to surpass her father in her mathematical studies and made important contributions to geometry and number theory.
                        
                        <!-- What did she achieve? -->
                        Known as "The Egyptian Wise Woman", she spoke in front of crowds who had travelled to listen to her lectures.
                        <!-- When did she pass away -->
			Hypatia was killed around 415 CE by a mob of extremist Christians, who targeted her due to her "pagan" teachings and Greek heritage and traditions. Since her death, Hypatia has become a symbol for education in the face of ignorance.
