                        Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler was born in 1914 in Austria. She was privately tutored from the age of 4. In addition to her technological contributions, she had a well-known career in film.
			
                        <!-- Anything notable from her time at univeristy/college? -->
                        
			</p>
                        <!-- What did she achieve? -->
                        <p>
			During World War II, she submitted her idea to prevent signal-jamming of radio guided torpedoes to the National Inventor's Council. This technology was used to control torpedoes and communication, and is the foundation for bluetooth, wifi, and radio communication in use today. Her idea, developed with composer George Anthiel, was to change the radio signal using the same technology a player piano uses to change notes. If both the transmitter and reciever had the same pre-defined sequence of frequencies to follow, the two would stay in sync while being much harder to track by outside devices that did not know the sequence. 
			This prevented eavesdropping, signal jamming, and reduced noise.

			Hedy Lamarr died in 2000 in the United States.
