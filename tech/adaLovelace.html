                        Ada King, countess of Lovelace, was born in London in 1815. She was educated at home by her mother, who was a mathematician, as well as  many tutors. Her mother focused on her education to balance out the influence of her father, Lord Byron.

                        <!-- Anything notable from her time at univeristy/college? -->
                        <p>
			Ada Lovelace began working with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Machine, a mechanical calculating machine that was more advanced than any of its contemporaries. She wrote annotations for how it could be used, decribing a process by which it could be instructed to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This is known as the first computer program. But Ada was able to look beyond numbers and describe applications of the computing machine in creating music and even extending human thought.

                        <!-- When did she pass away -->
                    	<p>
			Ada Lovelace died in 1852 in London. An early programming language was named Ada after her, and the second Tuesday in October is known as Ada Lovelace day. On this day, contributions of Women in STEM are highlighted in her honor.
