## How to contribute
I wanted this repository to be super easy for first-time github users or hacktoberfest contributors. The first thing you'll need to do is install git onto your computer. Here is a site that demonstrates a few methods to do so, depending on your OS: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

1. On Github, in the top right hand corner of this repository click 'fork'. This will copy a duplicate of the repo to your own repositories. Feel free to also star this repository :)
2. Now in your forked repo, click the green code button. This gives you three options for how to 'clone' this repo to your computer. Since you have Git installed, use HTTPS and click the copy button to the right.
3. Open your command line / terminal. I use a Mac (I know, I know) so these examples will be in terminal. Navigate to where on your computer you want to copy this repo (I have a folder in my documents folder called programming, for example).
4. Type 'git clone 'your forked repo that you just copied the link to here' '
5. Now you will have a copy of the repo on your computer. Open your favoured text editor or IDE (such as VSCode) and start coding! Read the suggestion contributions below to get started.

## Suggested contributions
The main form of contributions we are hoping to get are informative articles about Women in STEM. Please do not copy and paste from other sites and please reference sites you do use. Do a little research about who they were and what amazing things they did that contributed to the world today. You will find in the comments of the code for each page some easy questions to research to get you started.
